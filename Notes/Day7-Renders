How do we call useEffect function.
We call this function by passing another function to it

useEffect( 
   { () => }
)
We use another function to call a useEffect as it is call back funciton.
It will not be called immediately but whenever the use-effect needed to be called.
When ever the component reders and re-renders or when state or prop is changed
 If you don't want it to re-render everytime then pass a dependices array

useEffect( 
    () =>{ console.log("new world")},[ searchText]
);
//Call this only when my searchText is changed

//shiimer UI - We place a skeleton of before the api is coming into the picture 
eg:-Youtube and Swiggy
