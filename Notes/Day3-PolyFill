//If your browser doesn't hape promise so poly fill will convert into into that browser
//If old broswer doesn't understand Array.map() the poly fill will implements it's code

babel- It's just a libraray and package . It takes some code and split out some code. Takes new code and 
covert it old codes as well .
in package.json we add "parcel index.html" in start scripts 
//updating something is known as render
keys are important to load faster

//We  can assign values to js var and that is valid code  jsx code
// var a =<h1>Hello</h1>
//Html like syntax ,but not html in js
//React.creatElement =>Object =>HTML(DOM)

//Difference between html and jsx

//Babel generate AST, Babel reads the code line by line and check angular bracket then it add to AST
//JSX used React.createElement which converts it into object then HTML DOM

const heading2 = (
<h1 id-"title" key="h2">
Namaste React </h1>
);

Babel Converts form the above code to the below code 

const heading2= React.createElement(
    "h1",
    {
        id: "title",
        key: "h2",
    },
    "Namaste React"
);



//THere are two package-lock.json one is normal and there is another in node module

JSX- It's a syntax or expression
