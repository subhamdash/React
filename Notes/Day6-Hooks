When we export default is like just returning a function it's like closure 
We can have two react function components then we can export directly
Export default - export default Emea -- This is a deault export so we default export
Named import you have to use {Emea} curly braches for named export
{} - The curly braces are not destrucring here
import Header, {TItle}  from "./components/header"  --This is also correct 

In defualt export we don't need the react the import and export name shouldn't be statem
WE can use header.js or header 
If we re-name and .jsx it is not problems, 

import * as XYZ from "./components/header"

then we can do 
<XYZ.Header /> this is sim;are to <React.Fragemnt>



We put all the hardcoded things to config files.


In react there is one-way data binding,In Angular there is two-way data binding




const Boday =() =>
{
    let text="KFC";
    return (
    <>
        <div className="Scontainer">
            <input 
            type="text"
            value={text}
            onChange={(e) =>
            {
                setSearchText(e.target.value);

                value=e.target.value
            } }
            />
        </div>
    </>
    );
}


Here in the above code even if we type something in the react code it won't work,
If we need a varaible that changes that is know as react-variable.

## const [searchText] =useState(); //We will get useState from react
retruns=[variable Name, function to update];

so hooks are nothing but java scipt function.
const [searchTextInput,setSearchText]= useState("KFC");


//We are reading and writing same time , this is known as two-way binding
React won't know change the values of var,let and const and it won't affect and I think it's not present
in DOM object.

in on click we can give function 
={ () => { setSearch("Hello")} }


React renders the whole component when ever the react changes
