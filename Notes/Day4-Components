// React Component

Everything is a component in react
 -Functional Component
 -Class based Component

 //A JS function retrun a react elements or composition of react-elements is known as function Component

 cons HeaderComponent =() =>
 {
        retrun <h1> NAMO</h1>;
        retrun (              //IF we want to return block of statemnt
            <h1> NaMo </h1>
            <h1>Nako <h2>
        );

        //We can skip retrun as well as it is a react function
 };
 //Name of the component starts with the capital letters


 root.render(<HeaderComponent />)
If there are two componets one is function component and another one is just normal constatnt then in render
we need to close the FUnction component in the angular bracket and normal code doesn't need it for that.

const heading =(<h1 id="title" key="h2"> Namaste React</h1>);
const heading2 =() => (<h1 id="title" key="h2"> Namaste React</h1>);

 const HeaderComponent =() =>
 {
        {heading}   //If we make heading as fucntion component then it won't work as it only work variables
        <heading2 /> // We can do this for fucntions or <heading2()>
        {} - We can write any piece of Java Script code here, Even if we give some malicious data
        It sanitizes it to make app secure
        retrun (              
            <h1> NaMo </h1>
            <h1>Nako <h2>
        

        );
 };


 //Nested Component are know as component-composition
 // Babel can come from parcel or web-package or else download babel to run the packages
 //Babel uses the compiler to convert new-code to old-code and the old code is know as PolyFill
