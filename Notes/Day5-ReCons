//<Title /> or <Title></Title> or {Title()} all three will work

const jsx=(
    <div>
    <h1> JSX </h1>
    <h1> Second JSX </h1>
    </div>
)
//In any jsx compoment there should be only one parent element
//Jsx should have only one parent , if you want more then go for div but we will get more head 
//we can use <React.Fragemnt> which is an empty tag

//React.Fragemnt is a component which is exported by React

const jsx=(
    <React.Fragemnt>
    <h1> JSX </h1>
    <h1> Second JSX </h1>
    </React.Fragemnt>
)

//Configure Driven UI

//props are know as properties . 

cosnt RestCard =(props) =>
{
    props.resturant.data 
}


cosnt RestCard =({resturant}) =>  //We are de-structuring the data
{

    props.resturant.data 
}

const {name, rating}=resturant.data


//If I want to destrucutre everything on the fly 
// Use the fucking spread operator(...resturant[0]) this will help to pass the param to args


//<head>
//<body>
//  <Rest 1>
//  <Rest 2> <img>
</body>


We keep a representation of dom . We need virtaul-dom in react as it is needed for re-concilation 
Reconcilation is diff algorithm b/w two Doms(Virtaul Doms and Real Dom)

            1
           /
          2   --- We just need to change only this virtual dom 
         /
        3  

// if there are 4 div's and another div comes up then it will fist get confused b/w real-dom and virtual don
//will re-render everything from the beginging
//so if we have some keys then it will re-render with only new one
//Never uses index as keys
